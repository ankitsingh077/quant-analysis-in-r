# Extract the 3rd observation of the 2nd column of core

# Create the object data using 5 random numbers

# Use xts() to create smith

## xts data has 2 parts, the core which contains the matrix and the Index which contains the time series
# information. Both can be accessed separately and manipulated and worked around.

# Read tmp_file using read.zoo and as.xts
dat_xts <- as.xts(dat_zoo)

# Convert sunspots to xts using as.xts().
sunspots_xts <- as.xts(sunspots)

# Get the temporary file name
tmp <- tempfile()

# Write the xts object using zoo to tmp 
write.zoo(sunspots_xts, sep = ",", file = tmp)

# Read the tmp file. FUN = as.yearmon converts strings such as Jan 1749 into a proper time class
sun <- read.zoo(tmp, sep = ",", FUN = as.yearmon)

# Convert sun into xts. Save this as sun_xts
sun_xts <- as.xts(sun)



# Select all of 2016 from x
x_2016 <- x["2016"]

# Select January 1, 2016 to March 22, 2016
jan_march <- x["2016/2016-03-22"]


# Extract all data between 8AM and 10AM
